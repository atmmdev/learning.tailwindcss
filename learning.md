## Comments about TailwindCSS
- TailwindCSS is a CSS framework that uses low-level 'Utility' classes to create layouts. This is known as a utility-first framework.
- Traditional CSS frameworks like Bootstrap use classes that are directly correlated to components (eg. Alerts, Navbars). TailwindCSS uses classes as utilities to put together to build your our custom components.
